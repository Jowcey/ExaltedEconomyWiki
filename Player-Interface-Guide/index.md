# Guide for the Various Player Interfaces

## Admin Shop Interface

Admin Shops can be accessed by using the following commands:

* `/shop` or `/shop [name of shop]` to open admin shops
    * To open the shop in the image below, you would type `/shop Specialty Shop`
    * Commands are ***not required*** to open admin shops. Instead, you can assign the shop to a physical block (*See **"Figure 1"** below*). See the [Admin-Shops-Options page ](https://jowcey.github.io/ExaltedEconomyWiki/Admin-Shops-Options/)for instructions on how to assign a shop to a physical block.
