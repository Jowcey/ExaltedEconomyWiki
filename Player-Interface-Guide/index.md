# Guide for the Various Player Interfaces

## Shop Interface

Shops can be accessed by using the following commands:

* `/shop` or `/shop [name of shop]` to open admin shops
    * To open the shop in the image below, you would type `/shop Specialty Shop`
    * Commands are ***not required*** to open admin shops. Instead, you can assign the shop to a physical block. See the [Admin-Shops-Options page ](https://jowcey.github.io/ExaltedEconomyWiki/Admin-Shops-Options/)for instructions on how to assign a shop to a physical block.
* `/pshop` to view all shops or `/pshop [name of player]` to open shops created by a specific player.
  * To open a shop in the image below, you would type `/pshop [name of player who owns the shop]` then select the "`Specialty Shop`" from the list of shops for this player.
